I was working at a non-profit, helping survivors of domestic violence and prepping for law school, when I fell in love with programming. In an adrenaline-fueled whirlwind I made the best decision of my life—I changed career paths and spent ten months self-studying and completing the [NYC Web Development Fellowship](http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2138/nyc-web-development-fellowship). At the end of the fellowship in 2014 I was lucky enough to land my dream job as a developer at [Bark & Co.](https://barkbox.com)

Being a lifelong learner is the core of my identity, and this site is my playground in which to explore topics, both familiar and those completely over my head. Over the last few years I've learned that the greatest growth in ability and knowledge comes from those times you feel completely out of your depth. Those times when you just feel stupid, and you start wondering how on earth you got hired in the first place, and what if you just tricked everyone into thinking you know more than you do but now they're going to find out aren't they oh god theyre definitely going to find out

My objective with this blog is to write quickly and often, to produce as much as I can without getting held back by the fear of failure or 'sounding dumb'. And who knows—maybe in 5 years I'll look back at all this and finally believe that I know some things ;)
