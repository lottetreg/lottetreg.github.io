I have six years of experience in professional software development, most recently as a consultant at 8th Light, where code is our craft. I thoroughly enjoy mentoring in various forms, and I strive to bring emotional intelligence to every part of my life. My favourite part of working with computers is working with people.

I was born in Germany, grew up in Singapore and the U.S., and have dual American and British citizenship.

I currently reside in New York City, with my partner and our cat-like dog, Pickles. I love to spend time outdoors, especially rock climbing. Iâ€™m currently learning to make my own clothes.
