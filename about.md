I have six years of experience in professional software development, most recently at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/), where code is our craft. I enjoy mentoring in various forms, and I believe that anyone can learn to program.

My favourite part of working in technology is working with people.

I have American and British citizenship, and I currently reside in New York City with my partner and our cat-like dog, Pickles. I love to spend time outdoors, especially rock climbing. Iâ€™m currently learning to make my own clothes.
